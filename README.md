# 🧬 Forensic Evidence Guide

Welcome to the **Forensic Evidence Guide**, a detailed academic and practical resource for the study and application of forensic science principles in the collection and analysis of physical evidence. This guide focuses on three core types of evidence commonly encountered at crime scenes:

- **Fingerprints**
- **Tool Marks**
- **Trace & Transfer Evidence**

This project is curated by **Ayush Kumar**, a B.Sc. Forensic Science student at Parul University, Gujarat, to help peers, trainees, and aspiring forensic analysts understand real-world procedures through organized theory, techniques, and applied documentation.

## 🧤 1. Fingerprints

### 📝 Overview

Fingerprints are the friction ridge skin patterns present on human fingers and palms. They are **biometrically unique**, **permanent**, and widely used in criminal investigations for individual identification.

### 🔍 Types of Fingerprints

- **Patent** – Visible prints (blood, ink, grease)
- **Latent** – Invisible prints developed by chemical/physical methods
- **Plastic** – Impressions left on soft surfaces like wax or clay

### 🧪 Development Techniques

| Technique | Surface Type | Reagent Used | Remarks |
|----------|---------------|--------------|---------|
| Powder Dusting | Non-porous | Black/White/Fluorescent Powders | Visualized with brush |
| Ninhydrin | Porous (Paper, Cloth) | Reacts with amino acids | Turns purple |
| Cyanoacrylate Fuming | Non-porous | Superglue vapors | Forms white polymer ridge |
| Silver Nitrate | Porous | Reacts with chlorides | Turns gray under light |

### 📸 Documentation & Handling

- Photograph the print in situ with scale and lighting
- Record location, date, and object type
- Use proper lifting materials: adhesive tape, gel lifters, hinge lifters
- Label with evidence ID, initials, and time of recovery

## 🛠️ 2. Tool Marks

### 📝 Overview

Tool marks are impressions or striations left on a surface when a hard object (tool) comes into forceful contact with a softer material. Tool mark analysis helps link tools to criminal activity.

### 🔍 Types of Tool Marks

- **Impression Marks** – Tool presses into a surface
- **Striated Marks** – Tool slides across a surface
- **Combination Marks** – Shows both impression and striation

### 🧪 Collection & Casting

- Photograph marks with oblique lighting and scale
- Use **silicone rubber** or **dental stone** for 3D casts
- Casts must be air-dried, stored in labeled boxes or bags
- Avoid direct handling — use gloves and tweezers

### 🔬 Examination Techniques

- Comparison microscopy between cast and suspect tool
- Identify unique wear patterns, manufacturing marks, and angle/depth
- Use metric measurements to estimate tool dimensions

## 🌱 3. Trace & Transfer Evidence

### 📝 Overview

Trace evidence refers to **microscopic or minute fragments** of material that are transferred from one person or object to another during the commission of a crime. Often the most overlooked, trace evidence plays a key role in establishing **contact** or **association**.

### 🔍 Categories of Trace Evidence

| Type | Source | Collection Method |
|------|--------|-------------------|
| Fibers | Clothes, carpets | Tape lift, forceps, vacuuming |
| Glass Fragments | Windows, bottles | Forceps, paper bindles |
| Soil & Vegetation | Footwear, tools | Layer-by-layer scraping, envelopes |
| Hair | Human or animal | Tape lift, combing, tweezers |
| Paint Chips | Vehicles, doors | Scalpel collection, folding paper packets |

### 🔬 Analytical Techniques

- **Microscopy (Stereo, Compound, Polarized)** – Size, color, morphology
- **FTIR (Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy)** – Chemical structure
- **Refractive Index Measurement** – Especially for glass
- **Density Gradient Tubes** – Fiber and soil comparison
- **SEM-EDX (Scanning Electron Microscope with Energy Dispersive X-ray Analysis)** – Elemental composition

### 📦 Packaging & Storage

- Never mix different trace types in one container
- Use clean paper bindles, pill boxes, or evidence vials
- Label with source, date, handler initials, and conditions

## 🧪 Equipment & Tools Used

- 🔬 **Microscopes** – Compound, stereo, comparison
- 📸 **Photography** – DSLR cameras, macro lens, angled lighting
- 📄 **Documentation** – Chain of custody forms, evidence tags, logs
- 🧴 **Chemical Reagents** – For print development and fiber testing

---

## ✅ Best Practices in Forensic Evidence Handling

1. **Wear protective gloves and masks** at all times during evidence handling.
2. **Photograph evidence in place** before moving or collecting it.
3. **Label everything clearly** — date, time, handler, and evidence number.
4. **Maintain a continuous chain of custody** with proper signatures and timestamps.
5. **Use tamper-proof packaging** and seal every sample.
